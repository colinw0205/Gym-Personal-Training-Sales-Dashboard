# 📊 Gym-Personal-Training-Sales-Dashboard

## 🧠 Project Overview
This dashboard analyzes yearly sales performance for personal trainers in a real gym (the names of the gym and trainers have been changed for anonymity). It provides a ranking of the trainers in total sales in each year, and shows how their performance changed for all years that data was available (2023 and 2024). This provides the trainers with a big-picture understanding of their performance, and can help the gym determine where to direct new leads to.
